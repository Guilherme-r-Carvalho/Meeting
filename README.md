## This is an early version, translation is rough and some parts may not work as expected yet.

English version of the group finding addon [Meeting](https://github.com/yizhi996/Meeting).

The addon scans the /World chat channel for group adds and lists them in a convenient manner similar to the Classic WoW addon Bulletin Board. Message the group leader by double clicking their add or pressing the DM button.

Additionally the addon allows the user to list groups in it's own system. These groups can not be seen by players without the addon but provide some additional functionality.   
On the browse screen these groups will display the current and target group size and an apply button rather than a DM button. When applying it will ask the player to select a role (Tank/Heal/DPS).    
As a leader you'll get a convenient list of the players that applied with their level, roll and a note they can set. Currently this also shows Gearscore but I plan to remove this as it's not a useful metric in vanilla.
